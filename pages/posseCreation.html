    <h1>Posse Creation Rules</h1>

    <article>
        In order to create a Posse, each player will first:
        <br><br>
        Define the number of models per posse
        <br><br>
        Define the posse’s ability
        <br><br>
        Create Models
        <br><br>
        Define each model’s equipment
        <br><br>
        Defining Number of Models <br><br>

        To define the number of models, simply agree with the other player(s). Define how many models each posse will
        have. <br><br>

        The game is designed for posses of anywhere between 2 and 5 models. <br><br>

        Then define an amount of money each team will get to buy equipment for their models. Anywhere between $60 and
        $100 per model is a good idea. This money will be pooled for the whole Posse. <br><br>

        Meaning that a member may have $80 worth of equipment while the other $40 worth of equipment for a 2 man is
        worth $60 per model. <br><br>

        Defining a Posse’s Ability <br><br>

        When creating a posse, choose a posse ability from the posse ability list. These are shared by every member of
        the posse, and modify how the posse interacts with the game’s core mechanics. <br><br>

        Creating Models <br><br>

        Pick an ability for the model. Give them a name. Establish the model’s three primary statistics. <br><br>

        Unless otherwise noted, each model has an Ability Value of 12, an Injury Value of 3, and a Mortal Value of 12.
        <br><br>

        Equip equipment cards to each of your models. To do so spend the available on money for each item equipped. Each
        model’s equipment must be distributed along each model’s inventory slots, obeying the limits based on equipment
        sizes. <br><br>

        A model should start with at least one piece of equipment in their Held slot and most likely equipment in their
        Quick Slot, as well as equipment in their backpack. <br><br>
        It is highly recommended for every model to have at least a ranged weapon of some sort and a medkit.

        MODEL FACING<br><br>

        Models have a front and a back facing. This is defined by a straight imaginary line drawn through the center of
        the model along the base’s diameter (if it is a round base).
        Every object at the line and forwards is on the model’s front facing. Every object behind the line is on the
        model’s back facing. <br><br>

        THE CARDS <br><br>

        Equipment Cards <br><br>

        Equipment cards all have three primary features. Price, Size, Name, Keywords. All equipment has all these
        features. But many have more than these. <br><br>

        Price:<br><br>
        How much the equipment costs. <br><br>

        Size: <br><br>
        How much space the equipment takes up in the inventory. <br><br>

        Name: <br><br>
        What the equipment is. <br><br>

        Keywords: <br><br>
        Features associated to the equipment <br><br>

        Weapon Cards <br><br>

        Weapon cards are equipment cards and are the primary way a model has to injure and possibly incapacitate other
        models. <br><br>

        There are two types of weapons: ranged and melee weapons. <br><br>

        Although all weapon cards have damage, some tools and upgrades also have assigned damage values, despite not
        being considered weapon cards.<br><br>
        Damage: <br><br>
        The die type and modifier used when forcing another model to make a damage check. <br><br>

        Ranged Weapons <br><br>

        Ranged weapons allow the model to perform a shoot action whenever the model takes a use held object action.
        Ranged weapons also have the following attributes: <br><br>

        Ammo Capacity: <br><br>
        The maximum number of ammo tokens the equipment can have at any given time. <br><br>

        Reload Speed: <br><br>
        How many tokens can be added with every reload action. <br><br>

        Fire Rate: <br><br>
        How many times this item can be used each time it is activated. <br><br>

        Recoil: <br><br>
        The penalty applied to tough shot tests taken past the first shot in a single activation. <br><br>

        Shooting into distance penalty: <br><br>
        The penalty applied to tough shot tests taken within certain distance intervals past 8”. The intervals are 8 to
        12, 12 to 16, 20 to 24, and greater than 24. <br><br>

        Melee Weapons <br><br>

        These are weapons used during the melee phase. Their two primary features are damage and size. <br><br>

        Tool Cards <br><br>

        These are cards that allow players to perform different actions when used.
        These are described under Special. Examples are dynamite and bandages. <br><br>

        Upgrade Cards <br><br>

        These cards can be used when equipping a model to modify a tool or weapon they may carry to do one thing or
        another.
        They are placed under the card they modify in such a way that their special text box. <br><br>


        Keywords: <br><br>

        Descriptive words on the card related to its effect. <br><br>
