    <h2>Welcome to From Lead to Dust</h2>
    <div id="p1">
        <article>
            <p>
                Fortune favors the ruthless in From Lead to Dust, a fast-paced skirmish wargame where greed and
                gunfire
                rule
                the
                frontier. In this brutal Wild West showdown, you and your posse aren't just looking to
                survive—you’re
                looking to
                carve your names into legend, no matter how many bodies hit the dirt along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
                With two to five hardened gunslingers in your crew, you'll fight for gold, glory, and the right to
                walk
                away
                from the chaos you leave behind. There’s no law here, only quick hands and cold steel. Every round
                is a
                desperate gamble, every fight a test of nerve. Shoot straight, think fast, and don’t flinch—because
                in
                this
                game, everyone lives by the gun, and most don’t mind dying by it.
            </p>
            <p>
                So load up, take aim, and let the lead fly. The West doesn't remember the cautious—it remembers the
                bold.
                Will
                your name be whispered in saloons for years to come, or will the dust claim you like all the others?
                There's
                only one way to find out.

    <h2>The Gameplay</h2>
    <article id="p2">
        During a match of From Lead to Dust players take turns which move through a series of phases. Each
        of which
        permit different the taking of types of action. In the game guns have limited ammo capacity. So that
        after
        firing
        them enough times one must take time to reload, or if there is no time for that, swap to a side arm,
        even if
        it
        means
        bringing a knife to a gun fight.
        <br>
        <br>
        The game is played over scenarios where posses of 2-5 models are vying for objectives and even for
        their own
        lives.
        Counting turns, ammo and causing havoc with explosives and even the infamous dum dum ammunition. All
        in the
        name
        of greed, the third of the seven mortal sins, none of which more dangerous than a quickdraw.
        <br>
        <br>
        When building your posse define for the game a number of characters per posse, establish how much
        money is
        to be spent
        each posse is worth, and then spend it on tools for killing, cheating and surviving. These are
        represented by item cards placed in each gunslinger's inventory. With these the gunslingers can take
        various actions in their fight. Your enemies
        will play
        dirty
        and so should you.
